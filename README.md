## USER STORY 

As an amateur wing/food connoisseur, I want a secure application I can log into and locate the best wings/food in my local area, so that I can enjoy the best Atlanta has to offer. When I use the Where's my Wings application, I want to be faced with a secure login page where I can login using my unique credentials or sign up for a Where's My Wings account. After securely logging in, I want to see a home page with a map of the Atlanta area with pinpoints on wing restaraunts and foods trucks. When I click on a pinpoint, I would like to see the name of the location along with the option to click on the name and have the restaraunts website open in a new tab.
